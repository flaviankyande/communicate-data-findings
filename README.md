# Prosper Loan Data Analysis

## by Flavian Kyande

## Dataset

This project explores a dataset from Prosper. Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending company where individuals can either invest in personal loans or request to borrow money. The dataset contains 113,937 personal loan records with 81 variables in each loan record.

## Summary of Findings

I was able to discover that there was a strong positive relationship between BorrowerRate and LenderYield regardless of any level of the variables. The relationship is linear in all instances and both variables can be a good predictor for one another. Investors also had a positive relationship with ProsperScore.

Other than that, there were other relationships such as one between IncomeRange and LoanOriginalAmount. Also there was a positive relationship between ProsperScore and LoanOriginalAmount. BorrowerRate and LenderYield had a negative relationship with ProsperScore. This meant that as your rating score increased, your borrow rate would decrease and so would the lender's yield.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I concentrate on the main features with a high correlation and how various levels of the categorical features would influence them. I start by plotting a distribution of both BorrowerRate and LenderYield. After that, I introduce a scatterplot to show the relationship between BorrowerRate and LenderYield.  

Finally, I make a multivariate plot of BorrowerRate vs LenderYield at two different levels. This is to solidify the relationship between the two main features, tested at different levels by checking if the relationship is still strong and positive.
